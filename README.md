## Summary

While it won't be a one-to-one translation to Des Moines, the extensive data gleaned from NYC Citibike will help take care of a lot of the groundwork in answering questions and planning out our new bike rental project. New York's bikes are ridden mostly by it's subscribers, at about a 4-1 ratio. These are likely locals who use the bikes mostly for commuting and day-to-day errands, whereas the single-use customers tend to use the bikes more on the weekends. Additional visualizations showing checkout times comparing subscribers to customers could help to dig even deeper into this, and could be beneficial for us as we weigh out whether to cater more towards tourists or locals in Des Moines. Also, a visualization showing paths of the most popular routes (by mapping start and stop points per bike per trip) could be very useful in showing the places most likely to be traveled to, by whom, and when. This could make choosing sites for bike placements easier for us in Des Moines.
